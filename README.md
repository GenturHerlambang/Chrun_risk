# Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook h8dsft_P2M1_Gentur_Herlambang.ipynb contains the detailed steps taken to explore, preprocess, model, and evaluate the customer churn dataset.


# Introduction
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a product or service. Predicting customer churn is vital for businesses to retain their customers and identify potential strategies for reducing churn rates. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features such as customer demographics, usage behavior, transaction history, and more.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is available at Customer Churn Dataset. It contains information about customers and their churn status, including features like customer ID, gender, age, usage patterns, account details, and the target variable indicating churn status.

# Key Steps
The project involves the following key steps:

- Data Exploration: Perform an initial exploration of the customer churn dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of churn cases.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Feature Selection: Select relevant features that are likely to impact customer churn and remove any redundant or irrelevant ones.
- Model Building: Build a machine learning model, such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier, or random forest classifier, to predict customer churn based on the selected features.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Prediction and Insights: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and analyze the results to gain insights into the factors that significantly affect customer churn.
